## Problem Statement

Physical climate risk is imminent and we are seeing an increase in intensity from storms and natural disasters. Hurricanes in particular pose a strong threat to the east coast of the United States as storms like hurricane Ian in 2022 being Florida's costliest storm. Physical risks like hurricanes can heavily impact consumer properties, especially mortgage backed securities (CMBS) which can lead to heavy losses for owners. 

Additionally, commercial real estate investment has grown red hot in the “Sun Belt”, inclusive of the Southeastern US, driven by migration, tech relocation, and de-urbanization. As more capital is pumped into this ecosystem, it is worrisome that investors may not fully grasp the threat that physical climate risk poses on their investments. These investments can be backed by retail investors (i.e., public REITs), retirement plans (i.e., public and private pension funds), and banks, among other investment firms, which percolate to many aspects of the financial system as well as average American’s financial prospects.

Our project aims to predict this property loss in dollars so that appropriate measures can be taken to reduce damage and improve climate risk intervention.
